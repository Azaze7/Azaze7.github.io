~ [Personal Project/Hackathon].

~ MAVERICK Won *Most Technical Award* & was awarded *4th Place Overall!*

~ Worked alongside members of the Atlas Development team to develop an indie game in under 48 hours.

~ Done during the Borderland Glitch Game Jam; with the prompt of making a game on a movie/tv show released in the '80s.

~ MAVERICK is a Top Gun themed game inspired by the gameplay style of 1942/Galaga using retro pixel art graphics.

~ Our team utilized the Unity engine for gameplay and GIMP for asset creation.
