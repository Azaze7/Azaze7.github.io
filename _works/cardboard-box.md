~ [Personal Project/Hackathon].

~ MAVERICK Won *Most Technical Award* & was awarded *4th Place Overall!*

* In this project, I worked alongside members of the Atlas Development team to develop an indie game in under 48 hours.

* My team & I utilized Unity & Visual Studio Code for the game engine & GIMP for asset creation.  

* This was done during the Borderland Glitch Game Jam; with the prompt of making a game based on a Movie or TV show released in the '80s.

* MAVERICK is a Top-Gun themed game inspired by the gameplay style of classics such as 1942 & Galaga; utilizing retro pixel art graphics.

* I have linked a full writeup about MAVERICK, our design decisions, & even ideas left on 'The Cutting Room Floor' below.
